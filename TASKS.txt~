Hey bros,

As you can see I commented out some models which i think
we should thing about them in the end! We want to complete the
basic tasks/requirements first that Leif wants:

1) Categories
2) Pages
3) Login/Logout
4) Registration
5) Add Categories
6) Add Pages
7) Share/Private pages/categories
8) Searching APIs functionality

So, those are the main requirements. We dont need a second app,
nor anything extra such as, Category_lists, Saved Pages, History
etc etc. We'll think about them if we have enough time left.

Next meeting on Monday, after 6.
